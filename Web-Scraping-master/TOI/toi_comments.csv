It is very sad that Sena spokesman Sanjay Raut seemed to be getting undue publicity for blackmailing BJP. It is equally a matter of surprise that why BJP had been allowing Shiv Sena to spoil the image of coalition having got taste of criticism that continuously came from SS for all the last five years. At times it was seen as imminent that SS will join opponents to compete hate speech against Modiji for no good reason.A spoiled ally is more harmful than a principled opponent.,76,0

"The biggest mistake BJP and Shah have committed was to have entered into a pre election alliance with SS.

"Sanjay Raut is the Digvijay Singh of sena. He will do to Aditya what Digvijay did to Rahul. If sena stretches too mush and the coalition breaks, it may be the beginning of the end of sena.

There is no Dharma in politics. What coalition dharma Sena is talking about? After NCP leader backed off from coalition talks Sena softened their tone and talks about coalition dharma. Amit Shah worked behind the scenes and Sena worked in front of news media and exposed their immaturity. They have to go a long way to lead a state like Maharashtra.,23,0

BJP should dump Sena but they will not do so as they are also power hungry crooks just like any other political party.,17,10
The main culprit behind all the problem is Sanjay Raut for making an alliance with BJP / NDA. He is a tendency to leaning towards communist ideology and Uddhav is not having any command to over rule his suggestions. Hence even after an alliance with SS & BJP it will be a volatile one due to Sanjay Raut''s crooked ideology.,16,0
